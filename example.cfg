#                      !command access
#
#   Use this section to define who gets access to what !commands.
#   Access can be granted by IP, GUID number, or everybody or nobody.
#
#   Follow this syntax:  auth_command = value
#   where command is the name of the !command
#   and where value is one of the following:
#
#       disabled  - this disables the command, nobody can run it.
#          Example:  auth_seen = disabled
#
#       everyone - this enables the command, everyone is allowed to use it.
#          Example:  auth_stats = everyone
#
#       a guid number - Define the exact GUID number. - If you don't know
#             your guid number, run the rcon status command, look for guid.
#             guid numbers are usually 6 or 7 digit numbers
#          Example:  auth_locate = 907568
#
#       an ip address - Define one IP address to allow.
#          Example:  auth_locate = 127.115.64.121
#
#       a wildcard IP address - Allows a range of IP's access to a command
#              this is usually handy for when you have a DHCP address from your ISP.
#          Example:  auth_locate = 66.114.146.*
